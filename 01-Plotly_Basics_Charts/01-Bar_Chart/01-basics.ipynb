    "# Plotly Graph Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly is a Python library that is used to design graphs, especially interactive graphs. It can plot various graphs and charts like histogram, barplot, boxplot, spreadplot, and many more. It is mainly used in data analysis as well as financial analysis. Plotly is a two-tiered company. The open-source tier is available for free and the other tier is a paid subscription. The open-source tier has certain limitations like the number of API calls that can be made in a day, etc. The paid tier has no limitations and has more features than the open-source tier.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will learn how to create various graphs using Plotly."
